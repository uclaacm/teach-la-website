        question: >
          How can you check if a number is divisible by another number in python?

        solution: >
          Take the first number % the second number. If the result is 0, the first number is divisible by the second number.
    - problem: 
        num: 2
        question: >
          Given the side length of a cube is 3 inches, write a line of code to output the volume of the cube (Hint: the volume of a cube is its side length multiplied by itself 3 times)
        solution: >
          `print(3**3)`


          or


          `print(3 * 3 * 3)`

Last video we went over some more common operators, but this time we're going *slightly* more obscure with modulus and exponents. But don't worry, we'll be giving you plenty of practice and by the end of this video you'll be just as familiar with these 2 new operators as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division!

You've likely been introduced to operators in your math class, but how can we use them in Python?

In this video, we'll be exploring how to **process** our data using python operators. You'll see some familiar operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as one you may not have seen before: concatenation! 

At the end of the video you'll realize that **different operators do different things to different data types.**

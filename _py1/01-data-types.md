Data is at the core of everything we do in Python! Essentially, data is just a **collection of information** which may include numbers, words, or phrases. We use it to tell our computer **what** we want and **how** we want it. 

In this video, we'll be going over 4 basic data types in Python: booleans, integers, floats, and strings. We'll also cover type casting. 

Don't worry if any of that sounds foreign to you! By the end of this video, you'll be an expert!

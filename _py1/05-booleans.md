We briefly covered booleans in our data types video, but in this video we'll be going *much* more in depth. You may remember that booleans can have one of two values: True or False. This video we'll be digging deeper into boolean logic, showing you some more operators, and hopefully instilling some boolean logic into you that you'll carry for the **rest of your life**! 

The concepts in this video may be hard to grasp at first, but after some practice you'll get it down in no time!

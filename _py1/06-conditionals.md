Booleans can be taken to the next level with conditionals. Conditional statements allow us to execute one of several **branches of code**, depending on the value of a boolean. "If" statements are the most basic form of what we call *control flow*. 

In this video, we'll be introducing you to if, elif and, as always, giving you a bunch of practice!

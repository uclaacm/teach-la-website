        question: "Now that you’ve said hello to our world, the other planets are kinda sad. Write a program saying hello to the rest of the solar system! You can either say hello to each planet individually or to the whole solar system at once, it’s up to you."
        solution: >
          `print("Hello, Solar System!")`
            
          or
            
          `print("Hello, Mercury!")`

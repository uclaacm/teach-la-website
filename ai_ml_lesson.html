  <p>
    We present a year-long, modern machine learning class led by UCLA students!
    Students will discover and explore the computational and mathematical tools
    behind artificial intelligence and machine learning! In a single year, they
    will advance from understanding simple AI models that predict weather to
    analyzing the complex AI systems that power self-driving cars.
    
 </br></br>
    Throughout the year, students will have numerous opportunities to learn and code with
    Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages in use
    today, with wide-ranging applications in data processing, web development,
    and machine learning. Last year, our students used Python to train AI models
    that predict stock market prices, guess the popularity of a song on Spotify,
    and detect handwritten digits. 
  </br></br>
    Learning machine learning does not occur in a
    vacuum! We encourage our students to think critically about the applications
    and ethics of AI. In the past, we’ve brainstormed which types of AI are
    best-suited to tackle facial recognition and estimate house prices.
    Furthermore, we’ve held in-depth discussions on the ethics of AI-powered
    self-driving cars and what it actually means for AI to be racist.

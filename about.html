<h2 class="title">Our Mission</h2>
<p>
    ACM Teach LA's core mission is to empower students in the LA area with the power of computer science, and to provide mentorship and support to students who want to pursue computer science, either academically or as a career.
</p>

<h2 class="title">Virtual Learning</h2>
<p>
    Due to updates with the COVID-19 pandemic, as of now, the majority of UCLA courses will be taught in person. As a result, Teach LA has shifted most of its classes back to in person instruction. However, our Python courses will utilize virtual spaces and will continue to operate remotely until further notice. As many of our partner schools continue to make the transition to in-person learning, we will work with teachers and our instructors to determine the best way to continue serving our students.

<p>
    If you have other questions, you can also send us an email at <a class="tla-link" href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>!
</p>
<h2 class="title" id="school-join">We're a School/Organization. Can We Work Together?</h2>
<p>
    Of course! Currently, we're looking to partner with schools to run quarter/year-long curriculums, as well as running one-off instructional and networking events. If you're interested, please send an email to <a class="tla-link" href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>.
</p>

<h2 class="title" id="schedule">Spring Quarter Schools and Schedules</h2>
<p>
    Due to the COVID-19 epidemic and UCLA/LAUSD policies, all of our classes are delivered online via Zoom. All times are in PST.

<h2 class="title">How Does Teach LA Work?</h2>
<p>
    Weekly classes sized between 15 and 25 students are led by UCLA undergraduates with an interest in computer science who also meet with Curriculum Directors weekly to prepare for lessons.
</p>
<p>
    Undergrads looking to support Teach LA’s mission can also contribute by joining our dev team and working to create essential tools and projects. This group works on a schedule separate of curriculum team.
</p>
<p>
    Teach LA also offers outreach events at LA schools, such as speaker events where undergrads talk about computer science topics or day-long activities with schools.
</p>
<h2 class="title">What Do Students Learn?</h2>
<p>
    Depending on the students’ coding backgrounds, we shape the class to maximize learning. Topics covered in the past include programming fundamentals, intro to web development, machine learning, and mobile app development. We’re looking to expand the scope of our topics, so if you’re interested, contact us!
</p>


<h2 class="title">Why Teach LA?</h2>
<p>
    As of 2020, only 28 out of 50 states have K-12 computer science standards, and only 47% of public high schools in America teach computer science. Specifically, students from minority backgrounds receive the least exposure to computer science, especially as school districts serving minority communities often lack STEM funding.
</p>
<p>
    ACM Teach LA aims to fill this gap by providing students in-school and extracurricular support. Our flagship program consists of quarterly structured classes on various computer science topics backed by robust curriculums and experienced student tutors. We've also developed an open-source online code IDE, with the goal of supporting students' computer science learning regardless of their access to a certain type of computer. We also perform outreach through events (e.g. Day of Code) and visiting schools and talking to students.

<h2 class="title">About ACM</h2>
<p>
    <a class="tla-link" href="https://www.uclaacm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM</a> is the largest computer science student organization at UCLA. It is split into eight committees (of which ACM Teach LA is one), each serving a different topic and mission. ACM regularly holds events for the UCLA community with the goal of giving students more opportunities to explore different aspects of computer science. UCLA students are encouraged to attend as many of the events as they'd like (they're free, beginner-friendly, and have free food). Organizations looking to work with ACM @ UCLA should contact ACM at <a class="tla-link" href="mailto:acm@ucla.edu">acm@ucla.edu</a>.

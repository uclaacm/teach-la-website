## Overview and Table of Contents

Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) are a set of three principles that we believe are at the core of ACM Teach LA. This brief report is the first of its kind, reflecting on Teach LA's progress within the scope of EDI, and our next steps moving forward.

## Title 1 Schools and Socioeconomic Barriers

Teach LA primarily works with Title I schools. Within these schools, we strive  to serve low-income and underrepresented students, who would not find a CS education accessible otherwise. We recognize the value in reaching out to individuals at a young age; inspiring their passion for technology early on allows them more time to explore their interests and build their self-confidence in their ability to use computers. Teach LA instructors instill the values of confidence, creativity, having fun, and inclusion into our students to offset the detrimental impacts of socioeconomic barriers and underrepresentation. Additionally, Teach LA hosts its own online code editor to mitigate the obstacle posed by students not having access to advanced computers at home –– the editor makes it so that all they need is a computer that has access to the Internet!

## Bilingualism

We also recognize that English is not a first language for many of our students or their parents. At our Brockton Elementary School program, we provide information to our students' parents in English and Spanish so that they may easily understand the importance of their child's afterschool computer science education and the opportunities CS entails. Our website is currently being renovated to offer an experience in Spanish for ESL students, parents, and educators interested in learning what Teach LA does, accessing our curriculum, and/or working with our organization.

## Speaker Series

It is unfortunate that we are unable to physically visit every school in the Greater Los Angeles area. One way in which we connect with students at schools at which we do not physically teach is by hosting one-off external speaker series events at these schools.  These speaker series consist of Teach LA instructors introducing themselves, explaining their interests in CS, engaging in discussions with students, and holding a Q&A session about CS, college life, etc. Ultimately, speaker series intend to inspire students to explore their interests in CS and pursue CS opportunities at university. In contrast, internal speaker series are day-long events at UCLA in which we bring youth to campus and allow them to participate in cool CS activities, demos, and workshops, and experience the life of a UCLA student! We hope this makes them excited to be a CS student in college.

## Actively and Explicitly Discussing EDI

We teach our students the importance of diversity and inclusion often. At Brockton Elementary, we have led discussions on why diversity matters when building products everyone uses. At past speaker series, we have engaged in group discussions about representation and inclusion. At North Hollywood High School, we frequently mention the ethical downsides of the AI techniques we teach students. We also have a "You Belong in AI!" podcast, which features exemplary role models in the field, in order to inspire youth and college students of all backgrounds to pursue AI opportunities, and discusses AI ethics issues in-depth.

## Instructor EDI

Teach LA is a strong proponent of the inclusion of non-CS majors. Teach LA consistently recruits instructors majoring in applied math, cognitive science, statistics, etc. Our committee's leadership has the highest diversity in terms of major. Teach LA also recruits instructors who are highly passionate about EDI. Teach LA's leadership and instructors has a well-balanced gender ratio. We strongly believe students learning from and working with successful UCLA students who represent their identity makes them more likely to pursue CS in the future.

## Next Steps

We hope to accommodate bilingual students and parents at all schools at which we teach this upcoming school year. Furthermore, next year, we are producing a video series that explores AI conceptually, without delving into the math, in the context of fairness, bias, and ethics. We hope this makes an AI education more accessible to underserved, underrepresented students, who are most susceptible to being adversely affected by the bias present in AI systems (e.g. facial recognition technology); we want these students to gain a solid understanding of fairness and bias in AI so that they can call out racial, gender, etc. injustices in AI and, even better, fix them themselves! Additionally, we will try to include more CS majors as instructors next year. Lastly, we will work hard to organize more EDI-oriented and non-technical external speaker series.

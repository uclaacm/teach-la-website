## General Summary

Throughout the 2019-2020 school year, Teach LA maintained its core program of providing supplementary computer science classes. In the Fall and Winter quarters, ACM Teach LA taught four weekly classes:

<ol class="text-1x">
    <li>CS Unplugged at Brockton Elementary School</li>
    <li>Intro to Python at Emerson Middle School</li>
    <li>Intro to Python at Sepulveda Middle School</li>
    <li>Intro to AI & ML at North Hollywood High School (in collaboration with <a href="https://uclaacmai.github.io/outreach/">ACM AI Outreach</a>)</li>
</ol>

In fall and winter quarters, transportation to these schools comprised **92%** of our budget.

In addition, Teach LA continued offering one-off speaker series events...

Teach LA also expanded the dev team...

In the 2019-2020 year, Teach LA maintained a positive budget balance. Teach LA received funding from the UCLA CS Department (faciliated through ACM @ UCLA as a whole) and from the [USAC CS Mini Fund](https://usac.ucla.edu/funding/docs/CS%20Mini%20Funding%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf), with a total potential inflow of <b>$TODO</b>. In total, Teach LA expensed **1470.72**, with **92%** (1,350.19) being directly related to outreach.

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the UCLA Computer Science Department instituted a "roll-over" policy for outstanding organization balances. As such, the net difference in Teach LA's CS Department funding of **$429.48** is applied to Teach LA's 2020-2021 budget.

### COVID-19

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, ACM Teach LA shifted as much of its instruction to virtual spaces as possible. For the Spring Quarter, ACM Teach LA continued with reduced instruction for North Hollywood, and shifted to speaker series for Emerson; due to technical difficulties, Teach LA was unable to continue with Brockton and Emerson.

Importantly, Teach LA did not have any costs for the spring quarter due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent virtual instruction (for both UCLA students and our LAUSD partner schools). As Teach LA conducted all of our events over Zoom, Teach LA incurred no transportation expenses.

## Key Points

* The **majority** of 2019-2020 Teach LA expenses were directly related to outreach.
* Teach LA's primary sources of funding during the 2019-2020 academic year were the **UCLA Computer Science Department** and the **USAC Community service Mini Fund**.
* During the Fall and Winter quarters, **transportation to and from schools comprised the majority of the Teach LA budget**.
* **No costs were incurred during Spring Quarter** due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent switch to virtual instruction.
* Teach LA maintained a **positive budget balance** in the 2019-2020 school year, but the net difference in CS Department funding will be applied to the 2020-2021 budget due to policy changes as a result of COVID-19.

## General Summary

Throughout the 2019-2020 school year, Teach LA continued to provide supplementary computer science classes, even when faced with unforeseen obstacles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the Fall and Winter quarters, ACM Teach LA taught four weekly classes:


1. CS Unplugged at Brockton Elementary School
2. Intro to Python at Emerson Middle School
3. Intro to Python at Sepulveda Middle School
4. Intro to AI & ML at North Hollywood High School (in collaboration with [ACM AI Outreach](https://uclaacmai.github.io/outreach/))

In the Fall and Winter quarters, transportation to these schools comprised **92%** of our budget.

In addition, Teach LA continued offering one-off speaker series events and expanded the dev team.

In the 2019-2020 school year, Teach LA maintained a positive budget balance. Teach LA received funding from the UCLA CS Department (faciliated through ACM @ UCLA as a whole) and from the [USAC CS Mini Fund](https://usac.ucla.edu/funding/docs/CS%20Mini%20Funding%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf), with a total potential inflow of <b>$2,472.43</b>. In total, Teach LA expensed **$1470.72**, with **92%** ($1,350.19) being directly related to outreach.

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the UCLA Computer Science Department instituted a "roll-over" policy for outstanding organization balances. As such, the net difference in Teach LA's CS Department funding of **$429.48** is applied to Teach LA's 2020-2021 budget.

### COVID-19

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, ACM Teach LA shifted as much of its instruction to virtual spaces as possible. For the Spring Quarter, ACM Teach LA continued with reduced instruction for North Hollywood, and shifted to speaker series for Emerson; due to technical difficulties, Teach LA was unable to continue teaching Brockton and Emerson students.

Importantly, Teach LA did not have any costs associated with Spring Quarter due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent virtual instruction (for both UCLA students and our LAUSD partner schools). As Teach LA conducted all events over Zoom, no transportation expenses were incurred.

## Expense Breakdowns

### School-by-School

<div id="school-by-school-pie-chart"></div>
<ul class="text-1x">
    <li>Sepulveda Middle School - $ 584.42</li>
    <li>North Hollywood High School - $ 576.27</li>
    <li>Brockton Elementary School - $ 153.48</li>
    <li>Emerson Middle School - $ 86.82</li>
    <li>Mark Twain Middle School - $ 37.47</li>
</ul>

### Quarter-by-Quarter

<div id="quarter-by-quarter-pie-chart"></div>
<ul class="text-1x">
    <li>Winter - $ 832.57</li>
    <li>Fall - $ 638.15</li>
    <li>Spring - $ 0</li>
</ul>

### Transportation vs Non-transportation

<div id="transportation-pie-chart"></div>
<ul class="text-1x">
    <li>Transportation - $ 1,350.19</li>
    <li>Non-Transportation - $ 120.53</li>
</ul>

## Funding Sources

### UCLA Computer Science Department

In the 2019-2020 school year, Teach LA received funding from the CS Department, a process facilitated through ACM @ UCLA as a whole. The majority of this donation was utilized for outreach purposes.

During each of the Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters, Teach LA received a **$450** allocation from the CS Department. The amount of funding received from the CS Department over the course of the 2019-2020 academic year thus totaled **$1,350**.

Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the CS Department instituted a “roll-over” policy for outstanding organization balances. Given that Teach LA did not incur any expenses during Spring Quarter as a result of the switch to virtual instruction during the COVID-19 outbreak, the net difference of CS Department funding (**$429.48**) will be applied to the organization's 2020-2021 balance.

### USAC Community Service Mini Fund

Teach LA also received funding from the CS Mini Fund during the 2019-2020 school year.

The CS Mini Fund is often used as a supplemental funding source for outreach organizations and typically covers costs associated with transportation, food, additional supplies, and more.

During Fall and Winter quarters respectively, Teach LA received **$828.98** and **$293.45** allocations from the CS Mini Fund. The total value of grants received from the CS Mini Fund during the 2019-2020 academic year was thus **$1,122.43**.

All club expenses that were budgeted to the CS Mini Fund were directly used for outreach (via transportation).

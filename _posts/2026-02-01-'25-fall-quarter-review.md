As the final autumn leaf drifted to the ground, the Fall Quarter of 2025 came to a close. Over these months, our teams created countless memories and meaningful accomplishments that we are excited to share with you, and that leads to our new quarter review blog!!! Every effort, challenge, and success played an important role in shaping our journey. So let's begin!

## Cookie Jar

Get ready! Our delicious cookies are fresh out of the oven! Cookie Jar is a playful yet educational project designed to teach students about the cookies they encounter every day while browsing the web. From helpful cookies such as session cookies—which improve efficiency and security—to harmful ones like zombie cookies that track and harvest user data, Cookie Jar helps students understand both sides of this digital technology.

Throughout development, Mirabel and her team faced the challenge of building a full-stack website with user login and signup functionality all within a single quarter, but they have mastered the art of baking. The team successfully crafted 6–7 distinct game stages, implemented a reward system that allows players to purchase in-game cookies, and designed a charming, approachable interface. With winter approaching, now is the perfect time to visit Cookie Jar and explore some digital flavors you may have never encountered before.

## Static Site

As our most important online platform, the Teach-LA Static Site continues to evolve and improve. This quarter, Static Site Director Jishan and his development team focused on refining the user experience and modernizing the website to reflect our current curriculum and organization.

Their work included fixing minor bugs, redesigning the Classes and About Us pages, revamping the Blog and Team pages to resolve formatting issues, and creating a brand-new Events page to showcase our past activities. Despite being a team of mostly new members, strong communication and an agile workflow allowed them to achieve their goals successfully. As Jishan proudly put it, “Agile to save the day.”

## Bias By Us

Our identities, shaped by background, family, religion, ethnicity, and experiences, make each of us unique. At the same time, they also influence our behavior, decisions, and perspectives, often without us realizing it. This is the central idea behind Bias By Us, a project developed by Manager Charlene and her team.

Through interactive sessions such as case studies, research analysis, and a survey-based game, students learn how bias can affect everyday choices, including something as simple as food preferences. By the end of the experience, students gain a deeper understanding of how bias shapes our viewpoints and why people may arrive at different decisions. Ultimately, the project encourages reflection, empathy, and self-awareness.

## Training Team

Stories will be passed down, and so is knowledge! This quarter, Training Director Megan guided 14 students as they took their first steps into frontend development. Despite a shorter schedule due to breaks, the team covered the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Git.

Every one of them demonstrated strong progress, earning an impressive average score of 11 out of 12 on the knowledge assessment and completing a final mini-project. We are excited to see these students continue building their skills and look forward to welcoming even more learners in future quarters.

## Fairburn

In their very first quarter working with students, Lead Neil, Tiffanny, and their team focused on building strong connections—both with their students and within the team itself. Lessons were filled with fun and creativity, including activities like a candy cane drawing competition that helped foster engagement and creativity.

## Beethoven

Led by Clara and Anusha, the Beethoven team introduced students to Python Turtle fundamentals. Throughout the quarter, students learned basic turtle commands, loops, variables, and conditional statements. According to the team, the most meaningful moments came from getting to know each student’s personality and learning style.

## React

Due to scheduling conflicts with their partner high school, the React curriculum team temporarily paused instruction this quarter. However, School Lead Michael and Curriculum Lead Shayla are already working on finding a new school partner and look forward to resuming classes soon.

## Emerson

With many returning students from last year, School Lead Javier and Bhavesh reviews Python turtle concepts with a flash, the team creatively incorporated current internet humor and “brain-rot” references into lessons, making the material more relatable and enjoyable. Looking ahead, the team plans to transition into HTML and CSS, giving students an exciting new way to continue learning code.

## Conclusion

As the blog comes to an end, we are incredibly proud of the dedication, creativity, and growth demonstrated across all teams. From innovative web projects to meaningful student interactions, this quarter was filled with fun, progress and purpose. With these experiences behind us, we will move into the next quarter with hope, ready to build even more impactful learning opportunities together!

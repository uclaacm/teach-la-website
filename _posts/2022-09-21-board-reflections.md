It’s been a hectic board cycle this year, going from a singular dev team president to eight different board members and restructuring midway through the term. These major changes, compounded with our growing number of members, made for a challenge as we navigated defining each of our individual roles as board members. With that, let’s take a look at what our board members have to say about their year!

* [Archie](#archie) - Design Director
* [Jiin](#jiin) - Learning Labs Director
* [Matt](#matt) - Dev Team Training Director
* [Tim](#tim) - Editor Director
* [Regina](#regina) - Internal Dev President, Dev Team Training Director

## Archie

*Position: Design Director.*

Allow me to set the scene of how my TeachLA journey began. It's my freshman year and I had just gotten an interview for the dev intern position. It’s going great until I hear Matt say, “So I see that you’re experienced in HTML/CSS/JavaScript?” Crap. I forgot I had that on my resume. Well sure, I am. Only if you call scraping together a few header tags and changing the background color of an html file made in Notepad “experienced”. 

As you can predict, dear reader, I did not do so great in that part of the interview. Nevertheless, I got the position! From there, I worked on Buffer Buffet and actually did learn about HTML and CSS. However, as I quickly found out I was very bad at what I was supposed to be doing (React) and very good at what I was not (design). And that’s how this position came to be! TeachLA has a lot of amazing developers (not me) but a severe lack of design infrastructure. As design director, my job was to be the point of contact for all things aesthetically pleasing. 

The first project I worked on was BoolBots. I came into this project via a Slack message from a stranger and a very questionable set of robot illustrations. I came out of it with one of my best friends and a much less questionable set of robot illustrations. People always say that CSS is their least favorite part of web dev, but there was something so satisfying about seeing my vision come together on the screen from a pile of HTML tags.

When the school year started, I was asked to work on a redesign for No Filter. I’ll be honest, this was the design I’m least proud of this year. It’s also the one I learned the most from. I spent so much time trying to come up with a creative design, that I didn’t think as much about how the design would fit the content and making sure it met accessibility standards. After this project, I learned to design for the content of the site instead of fighting it.

The next project I worked on is my favorite. Many years ago, TeachLA had tabled a potential learning lab about hex codes because we didn’t have the people to work on it. When I heard about that, I was disappointed. It sounded like such a cool project and I wanted to work on it! Eventually, I realized that nothing was stopping me from just doing it. So I did. During winter break, I sat down and coded for days on end. As previously mentioned, I am very bad at React so this was quite a process. But after a lot of hard work, Color Lab was born. Color Lab was the first TeachLA learning lab made by one person (with some help from Matt and Nathan ty guys <3). It was also probably the last to be made in this way. Nevertheless, I’m proud of creating this small piece of TeachLA history.

Winter quarter rolled around, and I continued with the BoolBots team to work on IfBots. We were all adjusting to being back in school, so the progress was pretty slow at first. However, after a *fun* night (let’s just say that I truly lived the college experience), I decided I needed to prove that I could still code. Don’t ask about the logic behind that because there is none. Nevertheless, I ended up accidentally doing half the project, so I consider my point proven.

Finally, it was spring quarter. The dev board was buzzing with excitement during the process of finding new interns. We weren’t planning on getting a design intern, but I was still excited to see the TeachLA family grow. Then, one day I got a Slack message from Matt asking if I would be down to take on an intern. At first, I thought he had the wrong person. But no, there was a candidate who was interested in design! So, this quarter, I’ve been teaching my wonderful intern Angela all about Figma, CSS, and all things design. We’ve also been working on a new design for the TeachLA static site. Keep an eye out for it launching soon :)
Overall, I would like to thank everyone in TeachLA for being such talented developers and wonderful friends. I’m so excited to keep working with you next year as Outreach Director!

*Position: Learning Labs Director.*

This past year was a very interesting period for Teach LA’s dev team as we went through a lot of new developments transitioning to an 8-person team and going back in-person/hybrid. We started off the year in spring 2021, when UCLA was still completely virtual. The main challenge for me this quarter was taking on the Learning Lab Director role and figuring out what exactly the role means, since it had not existed before. I received a lot of advice and guidance from Matt Wang, the previous Teach LA president who had kind of been doing the responsibilities of the “Learning Lab Director” (except he also had a lot of other responsibilities on his plate, which is why this new 8-person structure came to be). I ended up inheriting 6 project teams to manage: Dev Pathways, Cookie Jar, Selector Safari, Bias by Us (which I was PM-ing), No Filter, and Getting Mean about Error. Since I definitely was not familiar with all of these projects, I spent some time having one-on-one meetings with the PMs for each of these projects to understand where they are at and what kind of help they would need from me, their new go-to person.

As the quarter passed, I came to notice some common issues found within the Learning Lab teams. The three main issues were:

1. PMs and team members were either losing interest in their project or becoming busy with other committments

2. Learning labs were given to teams without enough ideation/information being fleshed out, leading to them not knowing what exactly to build

3. Learning labs teams often lacked a Point of Contact to communicate with

I unfortunately wasn’t able to really resolve these issues within the quarter which led to most of the teams eventually falling through. Although this situation was pretty demoralizing, being able to recognize these problems helped me kickstart one of the dev team’s most successful projects: BoolBots.

        BoolBots is a Python Boolean learning lab that was requested by Teach LA’s Python curriculum team. This is the first learning lab that was created during my time as the Learning Lab Director, so I really wanted to make sure that it would go well. The PM for the project was Nathan Endow, and he and I spent spring quarter preparing for the project to be built over the summer. I made sure that Nathan would get to communicate with Robert and Nikhil, the leaders of the Python class, and gather enough information from them about what they wanted from the Learning Lab. I also tried my best to relay quality advice to Nathan based on what I had learned from leading Bias by Us and being the Learning Labs Director. Throughout this process I ended up communicating a lot with Nathan and checking on his ideation work. Once Nathan got his team, it was smooth sailing from there – I checked in every once in a while to make sure things were going okay, but Nathan was such a natural at PMing that I really didn’t need to help much at all! The dev team is really lucky to have him :)

I also channeled what I had learned into the Learning Lab PM workshop, which was the first workshop I had ever hosted! I was pretty nervous but was happy to hear that many people appreciated it. I eventually ended up making a second, more improved version later on, which I’ll talk about later.

Whew I just wrote a ton about spring! Then came fall 2021, UCLA’s first quarter back in-person since a long while! This was definitely a challenging time for the dev team as a whole because we had to accommodate the insane amount of new people that joined the club on top of transitioning in person. To help with this I spent a decent chunk of the quarter helping Regina who was leading the React team, by finding and assigning tickets to people who already had React experience and answering any questions they had about code. As for Learning Labs, my main accomplishments this quarter were writing the Project Proposal document and Project request form (huge shoutout to Regina for helping on this), and helping Getty start the RNN lab and Nathan start IfBots (the 2nd Python learning lab after BoolBots).

Winter 2022 was a little less hectic as the dev team had settled into our in-person/hybrid format. This quarter I took on my own React Team! My team consisted of people who tended to have at least a little bit of experience with React but still wanted to practice. I spent a bit of time inheriting the Dev Pathways project from Einar, the previous PM, and then used that project to assign tickets to the people on my team. In addition to tickets I usually spent ~20 minutes in the beginning of the meeting teaching more advanced React concepts like useContext to the team. By the end of the quarter our team had gone through a lot of tickets, and I was super proud to showcase the enhancements we made during Demo Day:)

I also taught an updated version of the PM workshop from spring. I was especially proud of this one not only because of the great reception but also because the updates I made helped me reflect on just how much I learned about PM-ing and the general process of leading a team within the time I had been Learning Lab Director. I also led a Design workshop/critique session with Archie which ended up being a ton of fun! In terms of learning labs, I helped Prem kickstart the Turtle learning lab (now called Pen Pals) in a similar manner as I did with Nathan’s learning lab. I also continued helping the RNN lab, but this one eventually fell through in spring because of inherent issues with the learning lab topic, such as scope and complexity, that unfortunately didn’t really get sorted out in the beginning steps. This lead to a lot of back and forth within the ideation step, and it took two whole quarters to get the hi-fidelity mockup. Luckily Nikhil from AI was very responsive and collaborative, but despite this the team still went through a lot of bumps in the road.

In the end of winter, I ran for Dev President and got the position uncontested! My main goal coming into the position was to find an optimal structure/process that works best for the dev team. If this past year consisted of a lot of experimentation and trial and error, I now wanted to ensure that Teach LA goes on a more stable, solid track by figuring out what worked well and applying that. But before I could do this, I needed a new team! Thankfully I had Archie and Timothy with me again, except Archie would now be the Dev Outreach director instead of the Design Director. This was a new position that was created sort of in replacement for the previous Learning Labs Director position, since that role ended up having a lot of overlap with the Dev President’s role. The Outreach director role would focus on the deployment of new project teams, whereas the Dev President would focus on maintaining/managing the teams we have. Anyways, with Archie and Timothy there were still 5 more roles to fill. With the help of Matt Nieva, an ex-training director, the four of us interviewed 10 people over spring break, and by the beginning of the year I had my new team! Most of the new officers ended up being our interns from winter quarter, except for Nathan who had already been a solid contributor to the dev team. Despite this outcome, I would suggest the future Dev President to continue opening the officer roles to all members – we came across some very outstanding interviewees who were not interns.

I spent the spring quarter mainly settling in the new team and keeping the dev team afloat through the transition. I assigned people to new and old project teams with the help of the fellow officers, and hosted dev team meetings and board meetings in new rooms. In terms of projects, this quarter we kickstarted the Pointers lab, Linux lab in collaboration with ACM Cyber, the Python For Loops lab, and planned for a collaboration with ACM AI. I took the lead on helping Colbert and his Pointers lab team get started, along with communication with the AI dev team since I am also an AI officer, while Archie took the lead with the Cyber collaboration and For Loops lab.

And that’s a wrap! It’s truly been an eventful year and I’ve learned a ton from it. I truly hope that to engrain everything that we learned into the dev team’s operations, and I’m confident that the 2022-23 dev board will be able to have the Teach LA dev team flourish even more :)



## Matt

*Position: Dev Team Training Director.*

Overall, I’m pretty happy with the way this year turned out! It wasn’t just UCLA that had their first year fully in-person since the start of the pandemic, it was also mine and the other second-year’s first time being in college in person! Honestly, the first couple of weeks were a blur, getting to finally meet TeachLA homies who I’ve only “e-met” on Zoom, to meeting so many incredible people. However, we had our work cut out for us. For the first time ever in TLA history, we distributed the giant weight that the previous two pioneers of the dev team, Matt Wang and Leo Krashanoff, across 8 different team members all working to keep TLA going.

As a training director, working together with the other lovely training directors Regina and Ellie, the massive undertaking of both organizing the curriculum into three separate training tracks and creating took place:

1. Introduction to Web Dev and Static Websites
2. Introduction to React and Dynamic Websites
3. Introduction to Backend Principles
4. (A bunch of miscellaneous topics like advanced React, deployment, etc)
5. 
I’d like to say that this was a great tool that helped us standardize our training curriculum from year to year and that it’ll help lighten the burden for next year’s training directors as well. Something that we’ve been discussing ACM-wide is a way for us to push one of our many training resources as one to push as the de-facto ACM-backed guide to web development. I take great pride in the fact that we’re going to keep pushing the TeachLA dev-training repository and that I was able to be a part of the great team that helped make it a reality!

However, creating the training tools like the repository and actually teaching them to peeps in-person were two completely different beasts. So many things to keep in mind like:

1. How do you keep people engaged in-person?
2. How do you handle hybrid situations?
3. How does partner-coding or lecture-style presentations work in large classroom settings?

The largest thing I learned was that it’s so much easier to connect with people in-person as opposed to teaching on Zoom! Being able to see people face-to-face is truly a blessing after COVID and for the next training directors: something that I wish I could do better is to take advantage of the in-person medium! Whether that be through engaging more with people during lessons or doing more bonding activities like socials, I feel like I could’ve done so much more in the social aspect of TLA!

As I move on to other aspects of ACM like working with the dev team, I still use a lot of tools that we’ve built up through TLA like our web-dev training curriculum in order to help make our centralized web dev training that’s used by all of the interns, and we based our Dev Team Project Outline based off of the TLA Project Outline doc that TLA made this yr! I love the great symbiotic relationship that the ACM committees have with each other and will def use things from TLA moving forward!

## Tim

*Position: Editor Director.*

This year the TeachLA dev team saw a lot of changes, both to the internal board structure as well as how we generally operated. It was also the first fully in-person year I had at UCLA. Although this was a good change of pace from the previous year, which was fully remote, it also came with its own host of challenges. For example, especially nearer the start of the year, there were often communication and productivity issues due to the hybrid format we were using.

In terms of board changes, this was the first term in which the dev team had a formal group of board members, which distributed the workload as the club and its operations expanded. When I first joined the dev team, basically everyone was working on the editor, with additional projects like the learning labs being pretty far out on the horizon. It’s been a real pleasure working with everyone, both old and new faces, and watching the club grow to its current state. I hope to continue to see the club grow over the next year, and also in the future after.

Over my past few years at UCLA, I have been working on the TeachLA Editor in various ways. The last couple of years saw me formally leading the editor team, and it was definitely an interesting experience for me. The work that I oversaw included both refactors to the Go backend, as well as incremental changes to the upcoming classes feature. This allowed me to both try out management, as well as hone my technical skills. I am very proud of everyone who was on my team, even if they did not stay the entire year.

## Regina

*Position: Special Events Director.*

I joined Teach LA last year because of its mission to provide something that I consider myself quite lucky to have before coming to college as a CS major: prior exposure to and experience with CS. Computer science can be hard to grasp at first; from my own experiences in high school at least, there’s a certain intuitive leap needed for things to click, and it doesn’t really start making sense until that point. College is an entirely different beast from high school, with professors providing less direct guidance to students. As such, learning CS without any prior experience can be a much more frustrating and daunting endeavor. I wanted to help connect with other students so that should they wish to pursue CS in college and as a future career path, they would have a foundation to build upon.

Teaching was certainly an interesting and rewarding experience. I was mostly involved with the Python class at Emerson, and it was an enjoyable challenge to develop lessons every week and adjust our methods and the material we were going over based on how the students were responding and what was and wasn’t working. After all, isn’t it said that the best way to attain mastery of a subject is to be able to teach it to others? In the end, though, it was the flexibility, both for instructors and for students, and the variety of the speaker series and similar one-off events that really appealed to me, and so I became an intern to get more involved with them.

This was when the cybersecurity-themed collaboration with science educational outreach organization CityLab was just starting, and Regina, Kaitlyn, and I were invited to observe one of their event days to see how they operated. I really liked seeing how another organization approached teaching, how they incorporated a fun storyline into the day’s activities and pop culture themes into their workshops, all of which we could potentially take inspiration from for our own activities and events. After we became Special Events Directors, we planned to move forward with the collaboration, but then the pandemic hit and everyone had to transition to working remotely. Although the CityLab collaboration transitioned to a virtual platform, it still managed to go on in the end, which was in no small part due to the enthusiasm and dedication of everyone involved in the project. Major props to Alyssa, Leo, and the rest of the dev team for creating the amazing technical modules while we researched and designed the nontechnical module, and to our president Matt for providing the overall guidance for working together with CityLab. Getting to see the collaboration through to the end was very rewarding, especially since it was the first event I’d coordinated as Special Events Director.

It’s honestly been inspiring and humbling to see Teach LA making it through the transition to virtual learning and working remotely through the year so smoothly. The collaboration with BEAM and working with ACM-W on the upcoming Day of Code have all taken place in the middle of the pandemic. This year has not been easy, and I commend everyone for their dedication and passion. I have no doubt that Teach LA will accomplish even greater things moving forward, and I look forward to seeing it happen.

## Regina

*Position: Internal Dev President.*

When I applied to be a special events director, I just wanted to expose underprivileged students to computer science and give them the opportunity to find their interest in it. As for roles, I didn’t know much of what to expect, and looking back it’s been a very rewarding experience. It was also a lot of fun collabing with other clubs and making curriculum with Kaitlyn and Nina, my special events co-directors.

Starting off, we collabed with CityLab to put together a curriculum for a Cyber Day. To be honest, this was the first time I’ve ever worked to set up something with another group, so I was quite lost on how to approach it and how to really get the collab going. S/o to Matt for providing guidance with that and being a great role model for how it should be done, in addition to Leo and the rest of the dev team for creating the super cute modules which we provided to CityLab. It was a great opportunity to teach the kids about cybersecurity and a great training ground for learning how to collab on a shared goal!

After that, in fall, Nina, Kaitlyn, and I coordinated a collab with BEAM for teaching the kids robotics. Though there were a lot of technical difficulties because it was online and it was robotics, it was a great experience. The kids were bound to have some sort of technical difficulties like how some of the kids’ cords didn’t work, or the code just wouldn’t upload to the robot, or just logistical difficulties with delivering robots. While there were a lot of issues involved and last minute changes in curriculum plans, I think at the end of the day, it went really well! The kids were really excited and happy, the collab went well, and even though the documents might’ve been a bit confusing, we laid a really great groundwork for a reusable curriculum for BEAM in the future. We also met Laurel and all the other BEAM people and are probably going to continue working with them, standardizing the curriculum for use in the future.

Continuing on, close to winter break, when ESUC reached out to our organization, I wanted to lead a booth for eWeek Kid’s Day by creating a learning lab website for it. It was rather last minute and Matt was able to help me quickly put together a solid team of 3 TLA dev members, s/o to Darren, Getty, and Trevor for doing some great work, and set up a collab with Creative Labs, in addition to pulling in Karen, our amazing designer who literally designed the whole website. In terms of Creative Labs, special s/o to Bryan and Arjun for being amazing and guiding the dev side of things, and Maggie for giving us great UI/UX feedback. We couldn’t have done it without Karen or Creative Labs, and I really appreciate all their help. Also in terms of brainstorming and curriculum, s/o to Nina and Kaitlyn for always being down to bounce ideas and having my back when I needed anything.

Going into leading this learning lab as a PM, it was challenging and scary and, looking back, I definitely could’ve been better at communicating, among a lot of other things. I helped the new devs out, even though I wasn’t necessarily qualified, and learned about design and accessibility with Figma. It’s been a very rewarding experience, and even though it was quite stressful at times, with everything planned out finally—the beta test being next week, the event a day after, and the second event in a couple weeks after that—I’m really proud of us for making such a polished Learning Lab. Most of all, I’m excited for the kids to learn how the web works and be amazed by it!

Overall, it’s been a great year with TeachLA. Surprisingly, even with this remote setting, the kids were all super excited to learn more, and I also learned so much about tons of different things. Even though I joined TeachLA two years ago to just have an opportunity to expose students to computer science, TeachLA has really grown to be more than that. It’s definitely been a good time and I’m excited to see what TeachLA will become in the future!

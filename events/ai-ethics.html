<h1 class="title page-title">AI Ethics Speaker Series</h1>

<p>
	A set of one-hour, discussion-focused events that examine ethical problems surrounding artificial intelligence. Explore examples of AI use and misuse in society, examine what's caused these problems, and what we can do to change them. No coding or math is required!
</p>

<p>
	A joint collaboration with <a class="ai-link" href="https://uclaacmai.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACM AI Outreach</a>.</p>

			Predictive Policing
		</h2>
		<p>
			Police have started to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict crime. But there are problems: skewed and inconsistent data, feedback loops, and misuse. But how does it all work?

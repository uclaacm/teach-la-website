<h1>2019-2020 Accountability & Transparency Report</h1>

<p>
    This report summarizes Teach LA's finances for the 2019-2020 academic year.
</p>

<h2>Overview & Key Points</h2>

<p>
    In the 2019-2020 year, Teach LA maintained a positive budget balance. Teach LA received funding from the UCLA CS Department (faciliated through ACM @ UCLA as a whole) and from the <a href="https://usac.ucla.edu/funding/docs/CS%20Mini%20Funding%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">USAC CS Mini Fund</a>, with a total inflow of <b>$TODO</b>. In total, Teach LA expensed <b>$TODO</b>, with <b>SOME%</b> being directly related to outreach. 
</p>

<h3>COVID-19</h3>
<p>
    Importantly, Teach LA did not have any costs for the spring quarter due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent virtual instruction (for both UCLA students and our LAUSD partner schools). As Teach LA conducted all of our events over Zoom, Teach LA incurred no transportation expenses. 
</p>
<p> 
    In addition, Teach LA had to cancel Day of Code, an in-person collaboration with ACM-W with non-negligble expenses. Teach LA and ACM-W subsequently returned all funds to their respective sources.
</p>

<p>
    Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the UCLA Computer Science Department instituted a "roll-over" policy for outstanding organization balances. As such, the net difference in Teach LA's CS Department funding of <b>$429.48</b> is applied to Teach LA's 2020-2021 budget.
</p>

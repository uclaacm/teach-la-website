<p>
    This report summarizes ACM Teach LA's programs, events, and finances for the 2019-2020 academic year. The focus of this report is on documenting the committee's use of time, money, and human capital to further its mission statement: the provision of equitable K-12 computer science education in Los Angeles.

<h2 class="title">Overview & Key Points</h2>

<h3>Classes</h3>
<p>
    Throughout the 2019-2020 school year, Teach LA maintained its core program of providing supplementary computer science classes. In the Fall and Winter quarters, ACM Teach LA taught four weekly classes:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>CS Unplugged at Brockton Elementary School</li>
    <li>Intro to Python at Emerson Middle School</li>
    <li>Intro to Python at Sepulveda Middle School</li>
    <li>Intro to AI & ML at North Hollywood High School (in collaboration with <a href="https://uclaacmai.github.io/outreach/">ACM AI Outreach</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>
    <!-- For these four classes, Teach LA committed its instructors to their provided schedules, not cancelling any classes for the entire program year. -->
</p>

<p>
    Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, ACM Teach LA shifted as much of its instruction to virtual spaces as possible. For the Spring Quarter, ACM Teach LA continued with reduced instruction for North Hollywood, and shifted to speaker series for Emerson; due to technical difficulties, Teach LA was unable to continue with Brockton and Emerson.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<h3>Finances</h3>
<p>
    In the 2019-2020 year, Teach LA maintained a positive budget balance. Teach LA received funding from the UCLA CS Department (faciliated through ACM @ UCLA as a whole) and from the <a href="https://usac.ucla.edu/funding/docs/CS%20Mini%20Funding%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf">USAC CS Mini Fund</a>, with a total inflow of <b>$TODO</b>. In total, Teach LA expensed <b>$TODO</b>, with <b>SOME%</b> being directly related to outreach. 
</p>

<p>
    Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, the UCLA Computer Science Department instituted a "roll-over" policy for outstanding organization balances. As such, the net difference in Teach LA's CS Department funding of <b>$429.48</b> is applied to Teach LA's 2020-2021 budget.
</p>

<h3>Dev Team</h3>

<p>
    ACM Teach LA expanded its internal developer team, expanding from 5 members to a peak of 20+ developers. The dev team continued improving the Teach LA online editor, created a new website to bolster Teach LA's online presence, and kickstarted interactive microdemonstrations to support teachers.
</p>

<h2 class="title">COVID-19 Debrief</h2>
<p>
    Like the rest of the world, ACM Teach LA faced an uncertain situation with the COVID-19 outbreak. During the end of UCLA's winter quarter, both UCLA and the LAUSD simultaneously shifted to virtual instruction. To 
</p>
<p>
    Importantly, Teach LA did not have any costs for the spring quarter due to the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent virtual instruction (for both UCLA students and our LAUSD partner schools). As Teach LA conducted all of our events over Zoom, Teach LA incurred no transportation expenses. 
</p>
<p> 
    In addition, Teach LA cancelled Day of Code, an in-person collaboration with ACM-W with non-negligble expenses. Teach LA and ACM-W subsequently returned all funds to their respective sources.

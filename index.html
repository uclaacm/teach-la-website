            ACM Teach LA pairs UCLA students with schools in Los Angeles to provide free computer science classes. Our goal is to empower all students with the ability to code, and use it to make a difference.

        <p>
            Teach LA's flagship program is teaching classes, which typically meet once or twice a week for a quarter. Classes have a wide variety of objectives, ranging from an introduction to python or web development to advanced topics such as machine learning and data science. Each class balances instruction and time for hands-on experimentation, with trained teachers helping students learn and use the material.

            We've developed an open-source online code editor specifically targeted towards students learning how to code. Students can sign up easily, and our service stores and runs their code - which removes issues about using a specific computer, and allows students to access their code anywhere! We currently support Python, HTML, and Processing, and plan on adding more features soon!

Hey there! I'm Farrah, a 2020-21 Dev & Design Lead Intern double majoring in Psychology & Statistics @ UCLA. I joined the Teach LA family as senior because I wanted to learn more about web development to bring my UI/UX designs to life, and it's been a great experience so far! I spent the majority of my life in Hong Kong but have lived in Houston, TX & LA since then. In my free time, you can find me obsessing over my no-sugar boba or playing my acoustic!

Hey hey! I'm Matt, the 2020-2021 President for ACM Teach LA. I'm passionate about using computers to make the world a fairer place, especially with education. I love supporting all the people who do amazing things at Teach LA: from teaching classes, creating curriculum, running events, and writing code. Currently, I'm a CS and Math-Econ double-major at UCLA. I grew up in Toronto, Canada but now live in LA!

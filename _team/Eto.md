## Hey!
I'm Ethan and I'm a 4th year Psychobiology major with a future minor in Global Health. This is my first year in ACM-TeachLa and I'm looking forward to learning and apply my newly gained coding skills :D
## Fun Fact
I've never been able to touch toes :( (ironic because my last name is To)

    <p>
        Teach LA’s internship program gives interns the opportunity to take on more responsibility within the club, while simultaneously receiving mentorship and guidance from current officers. Interns are grouped into cohorts according to their intern title (e.g., dev team project lead interns are grouped into a cohort where they get the opportunity to learn from the current dev team directors). Teach LA’s internship program takes place throughout the winter quarter, and each intern is assigned a project to work on with the guidance of a current officer, either in a group or individually. At the end of the quarter, interns are given the opportunity to present their projects to the entire Teach LA board, as well as write a reflection post about their experience working on their project. Projects are closely tied to an intern’s title, (e.g., dev team interns this past winter created learning labs that covered topics such as stack overflow, bias in AI, and linear and logistic regression).

<h2 class="title">What's the difference between an intern and a general member?</h2>
<p>
    General Members can teach as an instructor, develop curriculum, or join the dev team. They attend curriculum/dev team meetings. General members do not have to submit an application, or interview to become a part of the club, and are welcome to join at any time throughout the year! To find out more about how you can join us as a general member check out our <a class="tla-link" href="{{site.baseurl}}/join">join us page!</a> Interns help lead curriculum meetings, make sure Teach LA runs smoothly, or lead projects on the dev team, depending on their role. They are included in both ACM officer/intern events and general curriculum/dev team meetings. As opposed to general members, interns need to submit an application, and undergo an interview to be considered for a Teach LA intern position. For more information on what Teach LA interns do please see the section on *What is Teach LA’s internship program*

<h2 class="title" id="teacher-join">What’s the internship process like?</h2>
<p>
    Teach LA intern applications are accepted through the general ACM internship program application, where applicants can indicate which committess and position’s they’re interested in. Our applicants for the 2020-2021 academic year went through a three part application process: general background questions, general ACM questions, and committee-specific questions. For more information on how we chose our interns based off of this 3 step process, check out the blog post <a class='tla-link' href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog/internship/2020/12/15/internship-retrospective/">Teach LA’s Intern Search Experience </a> written by our previous Teach LA internship director Bonnie, and our previous logistis director, and current Teach LA president Sophie.

<h2 class="title" id="school-join">How does Teach LA’s internship program relate to ACM’s board internship program?</h2>
<p>
    Teach LA interns are given the opportunity to meet other ACM interns and officers through the ACM Family System. The Teach LA internship program is also run through the general ACM internship program, and interns get a chance to attend ACM all hand meetings which gives them the opportunity to meet other ACM officers and interns, as well as hear more about what ACM board and other ACM committess are up to!

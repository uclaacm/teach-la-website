        <p>
            Teach LA’s internship program gives interns the opportunity to take on more responsibility within the 
            club. Interns are grouped into cohorts according to their intern title (e.g., dev team project lead interns are 
            grouped into a cohort). In these cohorts, interns are able to collaborate with other interns, and 
            current Teach LA officers!
        </p>
        <p>
            Teach LA’s internship program takes place throughout the winter quarter, and each intern is assigned 
            a project to work on with the guidance of a current officer, either in a group or individually. 
            At the end of the quarter, interns are given the opportunity to present their projects to the entire 
            Teach LA board, as well as write a reflection post about their experience working on their project.

                Teach LA interns are given the opportunity to meet other ACM interns and officers through the 
                ACM Family System. The Teach LA internship program is also run through the general ACM internship program, 
                and interns get a chance to attend ACM all hand meetings which gives them the opportunity to meet other 
                ACM officers and interns, as well as hear more about what ACM board and other ACM committess are up to!

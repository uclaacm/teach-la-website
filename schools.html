<h1 class="title page-title">Partnered Schools</h1>

<p>
    UCLA's currently on summer break, which is when we begin our recruiting cycle for schools. We're still hashing out renewing existing partnerships and seeking new ones - if you're interested in working with us, please shoot us an email at <a class="tla-link" href="mailto:{{site.email}}">{{site.email}}</a>!
</p>

<p>
    Note: due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, Teach LA is still in the process of evaluating all of our options. If you have any questions or concerns, please email us!
